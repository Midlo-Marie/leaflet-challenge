### leaflet-challenge Homework - Mapping Earthquakes with Leaflet

### U. Richmond Data Analytics Bootcamp (November, 2019)

> In this assignment, we examine the global distribution of earthquakes and their
> magnitudes using leaflet and Mapbox.

### Satisfaction of requirements

* The Leaflet application includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and access through an API key
* We include an ESRI Leaflet plug-in that was not covered in class to provide the bottom topography of the oceans and show the clear association of the tectonic plate layers with major geological features.
* The tsunami "tag" in the USGS JSON data was also used to add a marker to those earthquakes that were associated with potential tsunami conditions

### Key findings

* More earthquakes are detected on a weekly basis than are usually reported in the news.
* The US west coast is particularly susceptible to major earthquakes associated with the movement of tectonic plates at the eastern edge of the Pacific ocean.
* More earthquakes are being detected in Oklahoma, now being reported as due to increase fracking in that state.
